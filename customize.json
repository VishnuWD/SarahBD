Thanks for coming into my life, you made my Year 💙. I still remember when we first met, how can I forget it, it was night time I was doing some stupid website game and I am stuck, then you came into the vc like an angel 👼 to rescue me but instead you chatGpted everything. I still remember it like it happened last week. We went through lows and highs but you were the strongest 🙇‍♂️ and you are a lil rebal(which I like tbh) and and thought of Gifting you kaju Katli(I remember you told me once, that you like it), but paypal banned in your country 😭 I just got to know. Anyway I will send you some Virtual Kaju katli in What'sapp and treat myself with real ones.",
